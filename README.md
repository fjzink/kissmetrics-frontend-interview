# Kissmetrics Frontend Interview
This is a React `Table` component with sortable columns. I created a `Headers` component and a `Row` component to render the headers and rows of the table.

## Usage

Clone the repo to your local machine. 


```
git clone https://github.com/fjzink/kissmetrics-frontend-interview.git
```


Install the dependencies with your package manager of choice.


```
yarn install
```


There are scripts to run the development server and to create an optimized production build. 


To start the development server run the `start` script:

```
yarn start
```

Running the `start` script will automatically open a new tab in your browser.

To create a production build of the react app run the `build` script:

```
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist/` folder in the root directory of the project if it does not already exist and output your bundled project files into this folder.
